<Layout title="About Our Study Group">
	<p class="subtitle">
		Learn about our approach to studying the book of 2 Samuel and what makes our group special.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
	<p>
		Our 2 Samuel study group was formed to dive deep into one of the most compelling 
		narratives in the Hebrew Bible. Through the story of King David, we explore themes 
		of leadership, faith, failure, redemption, and God's faithfulness across generations.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Approach</h2>
	<p>
		We take a verse-by-verse, chapter-by-chapter approach to studying 2 Samuel, 
		combining careful textual analysis with practical application. Each week, we:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Examine the historical and cultural context</li>
		<li>Explore the Hebrew text and key theological themes</li>
		<li>Discuss practical applications for modern life</li>
		<li>Connect the narrative to the broader biblical story</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What to Expect</h2>
	<p>
		Our studies are designed to be accessible to both newcomers and those familiar 
		with the text. We provide background information, discussion questions, and 
		additional resources to help deepen your understanding.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Each weekly study includes detailed notes, key insights, and takeaways that 
		you can reference long after our discussions. We also link to additional 
		resources and related materials to support your personal study.
	</p>
