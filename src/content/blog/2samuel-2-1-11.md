## Overview

> In the course of time, David inquired of the Lord

In 2 Samuel 2:1-11, we see David's transition from fugitive to king. After Saul's death, David seeks God's guidance about returning to Judah, is anointed king over the house of Judah in Hebron, and begins a reign that will last seven and a half years there before becoming king over all Israel.

## Geographical Context

The events of this passage center on Hebron in Judah, where David will establish his first kingdom. Meanwhile, the house of Saul maintains control over the northern territories under Ish-Bosheth. This creates a divided kingdom and sets the stage for the wars between the houses of David and Saul.
