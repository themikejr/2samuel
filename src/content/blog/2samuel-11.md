## Summary

2 Samuel 11 is one of the most well-known and sobering chapters in David's life. While his armies are besieging Rabbah, the capital of the Ammonites, David remains in Jerusalem where he commits adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrates the death of her husband Uriah. This chapter marks a turning point in David's reign, as the consequences of these sins will reverberate throughout the rest of 2 Samuel.

The commentators swoon at the literary quality of this section of 2 Samuel:

> ...it seems as though the writer as pulled out all the stops of his remarkable narrative art in order to achieve a brilliant realization of this crucially pivotal episode. The deployment of thematic key words, the shifting play of dialog, the intricate relation between instructions and their execution, the cultivated ambiguities of motive, are orchestrated with a richness that scarcely has an equal in ancient narrative. Though the analytic scholars have variously sought to break up these chapters, into editorial frame and Succession Narrative, Prophetic composition and old source, emending patches of the text as they proceed, such efforts are best passed over in silence, for the powerful literary integrity of the text speaks for itself.

## Study Notes

### The Cascade of Sending

The Hebrew verb "to send" (שָׁלַח, *shalach*) reverberates throughout 2 Samuel 11, appearing repeatedly as David attempts to control the unfolding disaster of his own making. He sends messengers to inquire about Bathsheba (v. 3), sends messengers to bring her to him (v. 4), sends for Uriah to return from battle (v. 6), sends Uriah back to Joab with his own death warrant (v. 14), and finally sends to bring Bathsheba to his house as his wife (v. 27). Each act of sending represents an attempt to manage reality, to contain the situation, to control the narrative.

But the sending fails to achieve its aim. What begins as a simple summons spirals into adultery, then cover-up, then conspiracy, then murder. Each attempt to control the situation through another act of sending only draws David deeper into the web of sin's consequences. The very means by which he seeks to maintain control becomes the mechanism of his entanglement.

This pattern is evocative of how sin itself operates — not as a single discrete act but as a multifactorial reality that becomes increasingly enmeshed in each situation, clouding judgment, breaking relationships, and scarring everything it touches. As Campbell observes:

> A further aspect of the story is the effect of what we might call "act-consequence" thinking. It is a strong feature of Israel's understanding of its world. The acts that people performed wove a web of consequences within which they had to live (e.g., Ps 7:16–17 [Heb.; NRSV, 7:15–16]; Prov 26:27). The web woven by David has drawn him into sexual violence and homicidal violence. Its consequences within the action of the story are the death of his child. Its consequences sketched by Nathan will never leave his house. God's forgiveness can restore God's relationship with David. Forgiveness alone cannot unravel the web that has been woven.

### Evil in Whose Eyes?

One of the most chilling literary contrasts in this chapter appears in the Hebrew between David's message to Joab (v. 25) and the narrator's final verdict (v. 27). After orchestrating Uriah's death, David sends word to Joab:

> And the king said to the messenger, "Thus shall you say to Joab, '**Let this thing not seem evil in your eyes**, for the sword devours sometimes one way and sometimes another. Battle all the more fiercely against the city and destroy it.' And so rouse his spirits."
> <cite>2 Samuel 11:25, Robert Alter translation</cite>

David frames Uriah's murder as mere military casualties—the random fortunes of war—and urges Joab not to see it as particularly troubling. But the narrator has the final word, and it stands in direct moral opposition:

> But **the thing that David had done was evil in the eyes of the LORD**.
> <cite>2 Samuel 11:27</cite>

What David commanded Joab not to see as evil (רַע, *ra*), YHWH sees as exactly that. The Hebrew phrase "in [one's] eyes" (בְּעֵינֶיךָ, *be'eynekha* / בְּעֵינֵי, *be'eyney*) is a common biblical idiom for moral judgment or perspective. David's moral vision has become so compromised that he can rationalize murder, but God's judgment remains clear and uncompromising. *This may be David's final attempt to control truth itself — to define reality through his words — but it is YHWH's assessment that prevails and remains actual.* This stark contrast sets up the confrontation with Nathan the prophet that will follow in chapter 12.
