## Overview

> How the mighty have fallen

In 2 Samuel 1:17-27, we encounter David's lament for Saul and Jonathan.
This lament was to be taught to the people of Judah and was recorded for historical transmission.

## Geographical Context

The events leading up to this lament took place in the hill country of Israel.
We need to understand both where David was (and had been) _and_ the overall political borders of the area.

David is told of Saul's death:

## Notes

- 1:20: _tell it not in Gath...Ashkelon_ -- let's get our geographical bearings.
- 1:20: what are David's previous encounters with Gath, Ashkelon, and the Philistines?
- 1:21: why would a shield be annointed with oil?
- 1:22: when "blood and fat" are mentioned together in the Old Testmanent, what do they typically represent?
- 1:23: _in life and in death they were not divided_ -- is it normal to be so charitable in speaking of someone after their death?
- 1:24: apparently Saul's reign had led to some material prosperity for the Israelites.
- 1:26: _suprassing the love of women_ -- what are we to make of this?

### David & Jonathan: homoerotic?

> Repeated, unconvincing attempts have been made to read a homoerotic implication into these words.
> The reported details of the David story suggest that his various attachments to women are motivated by pragmatic rather than emotional concerns --
> and in one instance, by lust. This disposition however, tells us little about David's sexual orientation. The bond between men in this warrior culture could easily be stronger than the bond between men and women.

### A Eulogistic perspective

> ...Israel's defeat was no military accident but part of the divine plan.
> On the other hand, there was no harm in stressing the achievements and positive qualities of the falled heroes in one's final tribute to them.
> In such a situation it would be churlish, even by present-day standards, to dwell on the failures and weaknesses of the dead.
