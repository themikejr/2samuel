## Overview

> How the mighty have fallen

In 2 Samuel 1:17-27, we encounter David's lament for Saul and Jonathan.
This lament was to be taught to the people of Judah and was recorded for historical transmission.

## Geographical Context

The events leading up to this lament took place in the hill country of Israel.
We need to understand both where David was (and had been) _and_ the overall political borders of the area.

David is told of Saul's death:

## Notes

- 1:20: _tell it not in Gath...Ashkelon_ -- let's get our geographical bearings.
- 1:20: what are David's previous encounters with Gath, Ashkelon, and the Philistines?
- 1:21: why would a shield be annointed with oil?
- 1:22: when "blood and fat" are mentioned together in the Old Testmanent, what do they typically represent?
- 1:23: _in life and in death they were not divided_ -- is it normal to be so charitable in speaking of someone after their death?
- 1:24: apparently Saul's reign had led to some material prosperity for the Israelites.
- 1:26: _suprassing the love of women_ -- what are we to make of this?

### David & Jonathan: homoerotic?

> Repeated, unconvincing attempts have been made to read a homoerotic implication into these words.
> The reported details of the David story suggest that his various attachments to women are motivated by pragmatic rather than emotional concerns --
> and in one instance, by lust. This disposition however, tells us little about David's sexual orientation. The bond between men in this warrior culture could easily be stronger than the bond between men and women.

### A Eulogistic perspective

> ...Israel's defeat was no military accident but part of the divine plan.
> On the other hand, there was no harm in stressing the achievements and positive qualities of the falled heroes in one's final tribute to them.
> In such a situation it would be churlish, even by present-day standards, to dwell on the failures and weaknesses of the dead.

### The Book of Jashar

> A now-lost book of Israelite epic poetry quoted at least twice in the Old Testament (Josh 10:12–13; 2 Sam 1:19–27; see also 1 Kgs 8:12–13).
> Also known as the “book of the upright.”
>
> Background
> The Book of Jashar may have been a collection of poetry about pious heroes in Israel’s past. The term “Jashar” (יָשָׁר, yashar) is a common adjective in the Hebrew Bible meaning “righteous” or “upright.” It may be used as a proper name in the title, similar to Jeshurun, a poetic name for Israel that also means “upright” (Deut 32:15; 33:5, 26; Isa 44:2).
>
> Biblical Relevance
> Since the Book of Jashar is now lost, any knowledge of the book must be surmised from the Old Testament citations. The text is referred to by various names in different passages and biblical translations, as illustrated below:
>
> **Joshua 10:13**
> The first biblical reference to the Book of Jashar occurs in Josh 10:13: “The sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar” (NIV). The Latin Vulgate translates the Hebrew phrase “Book of Jashar” as “the book of [the] righteous” (in libro Iustorum). The Septuagint of Joshua does not contain any reference to this source, possibly indicating the source was missing from the underlying Hebrew text on which the Septuagint is based. This would provide evidence for the existence of a proto-Masoretic text of the book of Joshua that lacks this citation (de Troyer, “Is This Not Written” 46).
>
> **2 Samuel 1:18**
> The second reference to the Book of Jashar occurs in 2 Sam 1:18, which introduces David’s elegy for King Saul and Jonathan (2 Sam 1:19–27). The NRSV presents this reference as a parenthetical statement: “(He ordered that The Song of the Bow be taught to the people of Judah; it is written in the Book of Jashar).” The NIV places only the direct reference to the Book of Jashar in parenthesis: “and he [David] ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar).”
> The meaning of the phrase translated “song of the bow” or “lament of the bow” (compare 2 Sam 1:22) is debated. Suggestions include:
>
> - It refers to a composition within the Book of Jashar.
> - It is the name of the particular lament over Saul and Jonathan.
> - It is a tune or a title, similar to those in some of the Psalms (Cartledge, 1 and 2 Samuel).
>
> In Hebrew, the text does not include the terms “song of” or “lament of”; it simply reads, “to learn the bow (as written in the Book of Jashar).” The Septuagint version of this verse reads: “in the book of the upright” (ἐπὶ βιβλίου τοῦ εὐθοῦς, epi bibliou tou euthous), with “upright” possibly serving as a translation of the Hebrew adjectival noun “Jashar.”
>
> **First Kings 8:12–13**
> A third possible reference to the Book of Jashar appears in the Septuagint version of Solomon’s dedication of the temple: “The Lord has made known the sun in heaven, He spoke to those dwelling in deep darkness: ‘Build my house, an extraordinary house for yourself in which to dwell in newness. Look, is this not written in the Book of the Song?’ ” (1 Kgs 8:53 LXX; 1 Kgs 8:12–13 MT). In Hebrew, the first two letters of the word “song” (שִׁיר, shir) can be transposed to read Jashar (יָּשָׁר, yashar). This has led to the suggestion that Book of the Song is the correct name for the Book of Jashar.
> DeVries argues that the Septuagint’s reference to the Book of the Song is based on a Hebrew text, since no other explanation would account for the inclusion of this phrase. Consequently, DeVries included the Septuagint’s citational question in his translation of 1 Kgs 8:13 (DeVries, 1 Kings, 113, 117).
>
> **Possible Influence**
> The Book of Jashar may have also influenced the Hebrew Bible (and Septuagint) in places where it is not cited. For example, both 2 Sam 1:20 and Mic 1:10 use the phrase “Tell it not in Gath.” While this may indicate that Mic 1:10 was dependent on 2 Sam 1:20, it may also suggest that the prophet Micah was familiar with the Book of Jashar or that the phrase had become proverbial by the time of Micah.
