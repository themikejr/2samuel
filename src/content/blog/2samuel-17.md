## Summary

2 Samuel 17 presents one of Scripture's most dramatic examples of divine providence working through human agency. Ahithophel counsels immediate pursuit of David, while Hushai advocates delay—and God ensures the inferior strategy is chosen, sealing Absalom's fate. The chapter culminates in Ahithophel's suicide and David's safe arrival at Mahanaim.

## Study Notes

### Hushai's Tactics: A Field Guide to Sabotage

In 1944, the CIA's predecessor (the OSS) published the *Simple Sabotage Field Manual*, a guide for ordinary citizens in occupied territories to disrupt enemy operations without detection. Section 11 on "General Interference with Organizations and Production" reads like a playbook for Hushai's counter-counsel:

> (1) Insist on doing everything through "channels." Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.<br>
> (2) Make "speeches." Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your "points" by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences.<br>
> (3) When possible, refer all matters to committees, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the committees as large as possible—never less than five.<br>
> (4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.<br>
> (5) Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.<br>
> (6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.<br>
> (7) Advocate "caution." Be "reasonable" and urge your fellow-conferees to be "reasonable" and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.<br>
> (8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision—raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.
> <cite>OSS Simple Sabotage Field Manual (1944), Section 11(a)</cite>

Hushai employs several of these techniques masterfully. Where Ahithophel proposes swift, decisive action with 12,000 men, Hushai advocates gathering "all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba"—the largest possible committee. He makes a speech filled with vivid imagery (bears robbed of cubs, David hiding in caves) rather than concrete military analysis. He advocates caution, warning of the "embarrassment" if the first attack fails. And he flatters Absalom into personally leading the campaign, ensuring maximum delay.

The result? Ahithophel's sound military advice is buried under rhetorical flourishes and appeals to ego—exactly as the manual prescribes.
