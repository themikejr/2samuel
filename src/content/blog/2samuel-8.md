## Summary

In 2 Samuel 8, directly after God makes his covenant with David, we are told how many political conflicts were eventually resolved
in Israel, leading to a time of peace both outide and inside the nation. Some of the events depicted here will be seen from other angles
later in 2 Samuel. Psalm 60 and 1 Chronicles 18 serve as parallel passages.

## Poetry From the Front

Psalm 60 seems to situate itself in the midst of the battles mentioned in 2 Samuel 8.
The superscription says:

> For the director of music.  
> To the tune of “The Lily of the Covenant.”  
> A miktam of David. For teaching.  
> When he fought Aram Naharaim and Aram Zobah,
> and when Joab returned and struck down twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
> <cite>Psalm 60, Superscription, The New International Version (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2011)</cite>

When we read Psalm 60, we see a very different persepctive on the battles described in 2 Samuel 8.
In 2 Samuel 8, the author is showing us that God kept the promises he made to David in 2 Samuel 7.
We aren't given a timeline, or told much of what the experience was like day to day during this time.
In Psalm 60, we see that even as God was fulfilling these promises, it was a time of fear an uncertainty for David and his commanders:

> You have rejected us, God, and burst upon us;  
> you have been angry—now restore us!  
> You have shaken the land and torn it open;  
> mend its fractures, for it is quaking.  
> You have shown your people desperate times;  
> you have given us wine that makes us stagger.
> <cite>Psalm 60:1–3, The New International Version (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2011)</cite>

**_We ourselves often experience how the process of God working in our lives can be tiring, terrifying, doubt-filled._**

## Addendum: The Trajectory of Violence to Peace in the Christian Tradition

We should not be surprised or concerned if our Christian intuitions are uncomfortable with the violence depicted in the Old Testament.
There is a thread running through the Bible that emphasizes peace as a state more ideal than warfare.

### The Old Testament Looks Forward to Peace

In 1 Chronicles, David himself understands that his violent life prevents him from building the temple.
Instead, Solomon (a name derived from _shalom_) will be the one to build it:

> David said to Solomon: “My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God.
> But this word of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and have fought many wars.
> You are not to build a house for my Name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.
> But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side.
> His name will be Solomon, and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign.
> He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son, and I will be his father.
> And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’
> <cite>1 Chronicles 22:7–10, The New International Version (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2011)</cite>

Furthermore, the Old Testament looks forward to a new age of peace:

> In the last days:
>
> the mountain of the LORD’s temple will be established
> as the highest of the mountains;
> it will be exalted above the hills,
> and all nations will stream to it.
>
> Many peoples will come and say,
>
> > “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,
> > to the temple of the God of Jacob.
> > He will teach us his ways,
> > so that we may walk in his paths.”
>
> The law will go out from Zion,
> the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
> He will judge between the nations
> and will settle disputes for many peoples.
> They will beat their swords into plowshares
> and their spears into pruning hooks.
> Nation will not take up sword against nation,
> nor will they train for war anymore.
>
> <cite>Isaiah 2:2–4, The New International Version (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2011)</cite>

### The New Testament Proclaims and Teaches Peace

The New Testament authors understood the death and resurrection to _enable_ peace in a new way:

> For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,
> and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven,
> by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.
> <cite>Colossians 1:19–20, The New International Version (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2011)</cite>

Jesus himself taught his followers to engage in a self-giving, peaceful way:

> “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
> But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
> that you may be children of your Father in heaven.”
> <cite>Matthew 5:43–45, The New International Version (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2011)</cite>

### Early Christians Embodied Peace and Understood Warfare as Spiritual

Early Christians interpreted Jesus' teaching to love and pray for enemies literally:

> [We] have learned from [Christ’s] teaching and His laws that evil should not be repaid with evil.
> Rather, it is better to suffer wrong than to inflict it.
> We would rather shed our own blood than to stain our hands and our conscience with that of another.
> <cite>Arnobius, 305 AD, Adversus Gentes (Against the Heathen), Book I, ch. 6.</cite>

Early Christians saw the warfare of the Old Testament as something that was finished (not for Christians),
yet, is an informative picture of the _spiritual warfare_ we are called to:

> Unless those physical wars bore the figure of spiritual wars, I do not think the books of Jewish history would ever have been handed down
> by the apostles to the disciples of Christ, who came to teach peace, so that they could be read in the churches.
> For what good was that description of wars to those to whom Jesus says, “My peace I give to you; my peace I leave to you,”
> and to whom it is commanded and said through the Apostle, “Not avenging your own selves,” and, “Rather, you receive injury,” and,
> “You suffer offense”? In short, knowing that we do not have to wage physical wars,
> but that the struggles of the soul have to be exerted against spiritual adversaries, the Apostle, just as a military leader,
> gives an order to the soldiers of Christ, says, “Put on the armor of God, so that you may be able to stand firm
> against the cunning devices of the Devil.” And in order for us to have examples of these spiritual wars from deeds of old,
> he wanted those narratives of exploits to be recited to us in the church, so that, if we are spiritual —
> hearing that “the Law is spiritual” — “we may compare spiritual things with spiritual” in the things we hear.
> <cite>Origen, 185–253 AD, Homilies on Joshua, number 15.</cite>
