## 2 Samuel 4:1 - 4

_The situation in Israel and Saul's line_

> When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel became alarmed. Now Saul's son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Rekab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin — Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin[^1], because the people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and have resided there as foreigners to this day.
> (Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to leave, he fell and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.)
> <cite>The New International Version (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2011), 2 Sa 4:1–4.</cite>

We see that with Abner gone, Ish-Bosheth is worried, fearful, and weak. All of Israel becomes alarmed because of this. Baanah and Rekab are introduced. Jonathan's only son is crippled and so isn't considered a potential heir.

### Sin accumulates. Circumstances are complex and problematic.

Saul's character made him lose the kingship. Not everyone in Israel acknowledged Saul's loss and so Saul trudged on as king, and Ish-Bosheth after him. Abner tried to defect and unite the kingdom under David but was killed in the process because of ill will between him and Joab (Abner killed his brother). What is David to do as the anointed king? What is Ish-Bosheth to do as the de facto king of the majority of the people?

**The bible depicts real, complicated, messy people and situations.** In her introduction to the Hebrew Bible course at Yale, Christine Hayes says it this way:

> And that leads me to my second point, which is that biblical narratives are not pious parables about saints. Okay? Not pious tales. They're psychologically real literature about very real or realistic people and life situations. They're not stories about pious people whose actions are always exemplary and whose lives should be models for our own, despite what Sunday School curricula will often turn them into... The Bible abounds with human not superhuman beings, and their behavior can be scandalous. It can be violent, it can be rebellious, outrageous, lewd, vicious. But at the same time like real people, they can turn around and act in a way that is loyal and true above and beyond the call of duty. They can change, they can grow.

> Now Rekab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for the house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest. They went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rekab and his brother Baanah slipped away. They had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his bedroom. After they stabbed and killed him, they cut off his head.

## 2 Samuel 4:8 - 12

_David will not obtain the kingdom through the exercise of power_

> They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to kill you. This day the LORD has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his offspring."
>
> David answered Rekab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble, when someone told me, 'Saul is dead,' and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news! How much more — when wicked men have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed — should I not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of you!"
>
> So David gave an order to his men, and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-Bosheth and buried it in Abner's tomb at Hebron.
> <cite>The New International Version (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 2011), 2 Sa 4:8–12.</cite>

Banaah and Rekab use murder to deal with the problematic circumstance. They say their success is the work of God in response to injustice. What does David say?

### David remembers God's protection

David seems to notice that the claim made by Banaah and Rekab is dressing an unjust act in theological language. God _has_ promised David the kingdom, but would he realize it through murder? David's heart posture leans heavily on God delivering him:

> As surely as the LORD[^2] lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,

On David's heart, it's figuring our Christ, and our calling, see also:

**The path to kingship for David is now clear, albeit with the people around him in pieces.**

[^1]: There are multiple possibilities here, but for some reason, people from Beeroth are considered to be Benjaminite, at least to some degree.

[^2]: David is referring to God here via personal name. Read as "_YHWH_ has delivered me out of every trouble."
